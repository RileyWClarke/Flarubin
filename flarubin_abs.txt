Rubin Atmosphere-aided Flare Temperature Studies (RAFTS) is a methodology and software infrastructure that will enable studies of stellar flares in the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with a focus on flare temperature and temperature evolution, which remain poorly constrained compared to flare morphology.  Due to their short timescale, Rubin is unlikely to detect flares with more than one datapoint in its main survey (WFD). However, with the exquisite image quality and sensitivity expected from the LSST, a phenomenon known as Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) can be leveraged to constrain flare temperature from a single-point detection, which will enable statistical studies of flare temperature evolution using the unprecedentedly high volume of data produced by Rubin over its 10-year survey. We model the DCR effect as a function of the atmospheric column density, photometric filter, and temperature of the flare, and show that flare temperatures above 6500K at airmass 1.4 can be constrained by a single g-band observation, given the expected astrometric precision of LSST. This method will be validated on wide-field precursor surveys: Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Dark Energy Camera (DECAM) and ultimately deployed on the LSST WFD and Deep Drilling Fields to support an evolving collection of flare temperature measurements in Rubin.

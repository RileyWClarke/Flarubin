Due to their short timescale, the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is unlikely to detect flares with more than one datapoint in its main survey. We developed a methodology to enable LSST studies of stellar flares, with a focus on flare temperature and temperature evolution, which remain poorly constrained compared to flare morphology. Leveraging the exquisite image quality and sensitivity expected from the LSST, a phenomenon known as Differential Chromatic Refraction (DCR) can be used to constrain flare temperature from a single-epoch detection, which will enable statistical studies of flare temperature evolution using the unprecedentedly high volume of data produced by Rubin over the 10-year survey. Obtaining these statistics will constrain models of the physical processes behind flare emission as well as the relationship between flare parameters (e.g. temperature, duration, energy) and stellar parameters (e.g. spectral type, rotation, magnetic field). Additionally, given the destructive impact of hot flares on planetary atmospheres, an expansive catalog of flare temperatures will aid recommendation of candidates for biosignature surveys. We model the DCR effect as a function of the atmospheric column density, photometric filter, and temperature of the flare, and show that flare temperatures between 6500K and 40000K can be constrained by a single g-band observation, given the expected astrometric precision of LSST. We are in the process of validating this model on wide-field precursor surveys, including Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Dark Energy Camera (DECAM).

# Riley Clarke - Week of 03/11/2022

## 1. High-Level Goal

In this stage of validating the DCR toy model on ZTF image data, I am comparing a science image containing a flaring star to its corresponding reference image. We expect the flaring star to be astrometrically shifted in a particular direction (towards the observer's zenith), whilst the other stars in the image should be shifted in random directions.

## 2. Results & Figures

I wrote a .py script to produce delta-shift plots e.g. Figure 1 from last week's report, and used it to produce delta-shift plots for the next two epochs of the same flare. The intent was to get a glimpse of the time evolution of the flare star along the zenith-direction. However, the other two epochs don't paint quite the same picture. 

Script code: https://github.com/RileyWClarke/Flarubin/blob/main/ztf_shift_script.py

### 2.1 Algorithmic changes

-Added ztf_shift_script.py

-Added airmass, timestamp, and centroid marker to delta-shift plots

-Added option to plot delta-shift scatter plot with axes centered on the centroid of the points

## 3. Next Steps 

### Script improvements:

    -Add rerun kwarg to avoid sextracting each time

    -Add function to convert input MJD to Datetime to generate API query from timestamp + flare star coordinates alone

### Post-meeting action items:

Remake delta-position plots with:

-GAIA coordinates in place of ZTF reference img 

-Radial cut around science image center, ~2 deg radius, color outer stars grey

-color inner stars red to blue based on GAIA (g-i) color

-alternatively color inner stars by airmass

-Calculate airmass at center of image as sanity check

### 1.1 Papers Read
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07211/> Subband Image Reconstruction using Differential Chromatic Refraction

This paper discusses a procedure to infer the spectral energy distribution of a source via differential chromatic refraction (DCR), i.e. the wavelength-dependent shift of the source's pixel location within a specific passband, and use the DCR information to solve for the underlying images at specific wavelengths.

They simulate 3 sets of 25 source that sample signal-to-noise ratio and color, each set at a different zenith and azimuthal angle. They generate 200 exposures and test subsets (5,15,50) of the exposures to evaluate recovery of DCR-corrected images. They show improved astrometric and photometric accuracy over coadditive methods that do not correct for DCR. 
### 1.2 Code Written

Wrote a function (make_bb) to generate a blackbody SED in cgs units.

Used throughputs and rubin_sim.photUtils packages to compute color magnitudes & differences (u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z, z-y) of 15000K, 10000K, and 5000K blackbodies via LSST bandpasses. Functionized to compute for input blackbody temperatures and added illustrative plotting.

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07211/> Subband Image Reconstruction using Differential Chromatic Refraction

This paper discusses a procedure to infer the spectral energy distribution of a source via differential chromatic refraction (DCR), i.e. the wavelength-dependent shift of the source's pixel location within a specific passband, and use the DCR information to solve for the underlying images at specific wavelengths.

They simulate 3 sets of 25 source that sample signal-to-noise ratio and color, each set at a different zenith and azimuthal angle. They generate 200 exposures and test subsets (5,15,50) of the exposures to evaluate recovery of DCR-corrected images. They show improved astrometric and photometric accuracy over coadditive methods that do not correct for DCR. 

### 1.2 Code Written

Wrote a function (make_bb) to generate a blackbody SED in cgs units.

Used throughputs and rubin_sim.photUtils packages to compute color magnitudes & differences (u-g, g-r, r-i, i-z, z-y) of 15000K, 10000K, and 5000K blackbodies via LSST bandpasses. Functionized to compute for input blackbody temperatures and added illustrative plotting.

## 2. Figures

Figure 1:  LSST throughputs plotted on top of 15000K, 10000K, and 5000K blackbody SEDs. The left and right axes are uncoupled; the left axis corresponds to the throughput fraction of each LSST filter and the right axis corresponds to the spectral irradiance (?) of the blackbody. Flux magnitude is scaled to 24.80 in the r-band.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

We can now get some approximate flare colors in the Rubin bandpasses, for flares of different temperatures.

### 3.2 Goals

In order to emulate Gordon and Weixiang's DCR metric analysis for AGNs, we need to be able to calculate DCR slopes (or just the DCR offset) in the u- and g-band. Weixiang was able to point us to a paper with some instructions on how to produce the slopes. With the DCR slopes we can follow the example and plot the effect of DCR on flare observations as a function of the flare temperature.

## 1. 

### 1.1 Papers Read

### 1.2 Code Written

Wrote a function (make_bb) to generate a blackbody SED in cgs units.

Used throughputs and rubin_sim.photUtils packages to compute color magnitudes of 15000K, 10000K, and 5000K blackbodies via LSST bandpasses. Functionized to compute for input blackbody temperatures and added illustrative plotting.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Currently, I am making some algorithmic and organizational changes to the ZTF validation notebooks to improve readibility and programmatic usage, as well as starting analysis of the DECam flare candidates sent by Melissa Graham.

## 2. Results & Figures

The candidate_objects.dat file contains the following columns: 

|   | field  | candidate id | object id | object ra       | object dec    | object MJD     | object filter | object magnitude | object magnitude error | object real/bogus score | exposure id |
|---|--------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 0 | COSMOS | DC21jyeo     | 1244336   | 148.62794007568 | 1.02052083098 | 59360.98320209 | g             | 21.359           | 0.084                  | 0.956                   | 1107        |

| 4 | COSMOS | DC21jvtr     | 1233917   | 148.39461823291 | 1.40736340556 | 59358.01405379 | r             | 18.44            | 0.005                  | 1.0                     | 1061        |

There are as many unique object IDs as there are rows in the dataframe (see decam_validation.ipynb), so my understanding is that each candidate ID corresponds to a source and each object ID corresponds to a different flare. I also assume that a real/bogus score of 1.0 indicates 'real' and 0.0 indicates 'bogus'. 


The spatial distribution of the flare candidates in each field is shown in Fig 1 and the distribution of the R/B scores in each field is shown in Fig 2. 

I calculated the delta RA and Dec for the first and final MJDs of each candidate ID and plotted them in Figures 3 and 4. I calculated airmass myself using the same method as the ZTF plots, but glancing back at Melissa's email, I realized that the repo she linked has airmasses for each exposure ID, just in a different file, so I should probably use those going forward.

Fig 1: Spatial distribution of flare candidates in COSMOS and ELAIS fields in g-band. COSMOS is at lower gal lat than ELAIS, so the higher number of flare candidates in COSMOS makes sense.

Fig 2: Distribution of Real/Bogus Scores for flares candidates in each field in all bands. The mean R/B scores are 0.92 for COSMOS and 0.79 for ELAIS.

### 2.1 Algorithmic changes

I consoldiated all the code that produces ZTF validation plots into a single notebook (linked below) and functionalized much of the code that generated those figures. Still a WIP but better than before. 

Notebook code: https://github.com/RileyWClarke/Flarubin/blob/main/ztf_validation.ipynb

## 3. Next Steps 

-Use the airmasses provided in the exposures.dat file to remake Figures 3,4

-Incoporate our algorithm for calculating Parallactic Angles to remake Figure 3,4 with delta-PA colors

-The notebook containing the code that produces the ZTF validation figures should eventually be converted to  a .py script

-Seeing as we have magnitudes, we could use them to choose flare epochs to compare. For example, we could compare the position of the flare at peak mag to min mag rather than the first and last epoch.

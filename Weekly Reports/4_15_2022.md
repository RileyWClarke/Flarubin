# Riley Clarke - Week of 04/15/2022

## 1. High-Level Goal

Continuing to validate the DCR toy model on ZTF image data, I am exploring some enhancements and/or alternative verisons of the dRA vs. dDec plots generated from ZTF images. One representation is a version of the plot that uses GAIA positions as the reference catalog, colors the scatter points by their GAIA g-rp color, and diminishes pairs of stars on the periphery of the image. The other instead displays the delta-positions between two science images containing the same flaring star at two different epochs. 

## 2. Results & Figures

I wrote a .py script to produce delta-shift plots with GAIA positions and colors. I produced the epoch 1 vs epoch 3 plot in my scratch work notebook. I also created a gif of simulated positions and noise to motivate the expected outcome of the dRA vs. dDec representation for a flare with a resolved temperature profile.

Script code: https://github.com/RileyWClarke/Flarubin/blob/main/ztf_shift_script_GAIA.py

### 2.1 Algorithmic changes

-Added ztf_shift_script_GAIA.py, with supporing util functions for plotting, astropy x-match, and making a circular cut about the image center

-Script now skips the sextractor step if a catalog already exists

-Trying to make the GAIA cone search query programmatic via the API, work in progress

Figure 2. Epoch-to-Epoch dRA vs dDec plot with points colored by airmass. The flare star's low airmass is unexpected - additional sanity checks might be required

Figure 3. 

dRA vs dDec plot using 2 degree GAIA positions as the reference catalog and colored according to GAIA g-rp color. The GAIA positions are from a 2-degree cone search centered on the flare star.

## 3. Next Steps 

-Focus on improving the epoch-epoch comparison of the ZTF images. Once we have a representation that is convincing (shows the flare star shifted toward zenith with random scatter from the other stars and has correct airmass information), we can use the observed shift to generate a proof-of-concept temperature constraint from a single-point ZTF detection, and possibly create more constraints from other epoch-to-epoch image sets.

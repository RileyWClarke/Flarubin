## 1. High-Level Goal

In this stage of validating the DCR toy model on ZTF image data, I am comparing a science image containing a flaring star to its corresponding reference image. We expect the flaring star to be astrometrically shifted in a particular direction (towards the observer's zenith), whilst the other stars in the image should be shifted in random directions.

## 2. Results & Figures

Figure 1 shows the delta RA and Dec for all targets with separations less than 1" between the science and reference image. As expected, the flaring star lies exactly on the line indictating the zenith-ward direction, but suspiciously the center-of-mass of the scatter is offset by (0.0, -0.1). So far I have found no bug that would cause this offset, but replicating this plot for other images will reveal if this offset is systematic. 

### 2.1 Algorithmic changes

-Added threshold for bad astropy matches, default is 1" 2D separation

-Flaring star coordinates provided by user

-Zenith location calculated programmatically

Figure 1: Delta RA vs delta Dec for all targets with separations less than 1"


## 3. Next Steps 

-Check that Figure 1 can be generated for any image programmatically, convert to .py script

-Create figure 1 for the other two flare star images

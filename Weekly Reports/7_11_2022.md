# Riley Clarke - Week of 07/11/2022

## 1. High-Level Goal

Continuing to explore and visualize the DECAM flare candidate dataset in the delta-magnitude vs delta-time space in order to identify bright, fast transients likely to be flares at high airmass, i.e. the poster children for flare-temp-with-DCR validation.

## 2. Results & Figures

Fig 1: Difference in g magnitude versus corresponding time gap in hours for candidates in COSMOS field, g band, with real/bogus scores > 0.6. Additionally, any pairs with delta magnitude < 0.2 or within 68% (2 sigma) probility of delta magnitude = 0.0 were cut, leaving 8 candidates.

Fig 2: Delta RA vs. Delta Dec plot in COSMOS field, g band, with real/bogus scores > 0.6. Each pair of coordinates used to compute the deltas corresponds to the pair of consecutive points in the lightcurve with the most negative dmag/dt, i.e. greatest rate of change in brightness, above a set threshold (dmag/dt < -0.4 in this case) Each point is colored by the mean airmass of the two points and sized according to their |dmag/dt|. I'm interested in the cluster of points centered around dRA = 1" and dDec = 0.2" that seem to have systematically higher |dmag/dt| than other points.

## 3. Next Steps 

-Question for Jim: Which of the candidates plotted in Fig 1 are likely to be flares?

-Figure out the parallactic angle components for the points in Fig 2. Does the offset of the cluster correspond to the expected change in PA for DCR?

-Ask Melissa how to access DECam images

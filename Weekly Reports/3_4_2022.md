# Riley Clarke - Week of 03/04/2022

## 1. High-Level Goal

In this stage of validating the DCR toy model on ZTF image data, I am comparing a science image containing a flaring star to its corresponding reference image. We expect the flaring star to be astrometrically shifted in a particular direction (towards the observer's zenith), whilst the other stars in the image should be shifted in random directions.

## 2. Results & Figures

Previously, I was seeing much larger separations than we expected. This was because I was flipping the science image data horizontally in an effort to align it with the reference image, but doing this without also correcting the WCS header info was counter-productive. Jim suggested not flipping the image, instead just inverting the x-axis for displaying purposes. I generated sextractor catalogs and ran the astropy crossmatching on the now-unflipped catalog and got the distributions of separations shown in Figure 1. While there are still some large separations, these are likely bad astropy matches and can be ignored. Figure 2 shows the separations below 1".

### 2.1 Algorithmic changes

-Removed science image flipping 

-Added Sextractor command-line parameter options to the srcext() function

## 3. Next Steps 

-Create separation threshold to discard bad astropy matches.

-Find distribution of projected separations in the direction of zenith, i.e. separation * cos(theta1 - theta2), where theta1 is the postition angle of the source in the science image, theta2 is the position angle of the source in the reference image.

### 1.1 Papers Read
<https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/138/1/19/> Astrometric Redshifts for Quasars

The authors derive astrometric offsets of broad-emission-line quasars due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). They examine the DCR offset for a range of redshifts (0 < z < 5) and airmasses (1.0-1.8). This information could in some cases be suitable for determining "astrometric redshifts" of quasars. They note that future synoptic surveys (like Rubin LSST) could benefit from taking observations at high airmass to improve photometric redshifts for quasars.

### 1.2 Code Written

To reproduce Figures 3 & 4 from Kaczmarczik et al. 2009, I wrote code that ingests a composite quasar SED from Vandenberk et al. 2001 and shifts the SED for a given redshift value. It then calculates the effective wavelength at the given redshift and bandpass, and subsequently calculates the DCR offset along the parallactic angle (in arcsec) for a given airmass. After debugging the interpolation step, this code should reproduce Figures 3 & 4 by plotting the effective wavelength and DCR offset as function of redshift for various airmass values.

Figure 1: Composite quasar spectra from Vandenberk et al. 2001 at Z = 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 and the LSST g-band. This suggests the effect of reshifting different spectral features into and out of the bandpass.

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

By reproducing the figures from Kaczmarczik et al. 2009, we have a proof of concept for calculating DCR offsets at given airmass values. We should be able to readily replace the quasar SEDs with the blackbody SEDs at various temps.

### 3.2 Goals

Using the machinery from Kaczmarczik et al. 2009, we should be able to calculate DCR offsets for blackbodies at various temperatures. We can also calculate delta-DCR offsets between a quiescent M-dwarf spectra and the same spectra but with a flare on top of it, at some different airmasses. Long term, hopefully we can determine if the PSF offset due to DCR is larger than Rubin's astrometric error, in a best-case scenario of catching a flare on a cool, red star.

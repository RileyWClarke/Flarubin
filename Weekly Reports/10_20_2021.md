### 1.1 Papers Read

<https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/506/2/2089/6310584?redirectedFrom=fulltext/> The Deeper, Wider, Faster programme: exploring stellar flare activity with deep, fast cadenced DECam imaging via machine learning

This paper describes a survey of stellar flare events within 500pc with the Dark Energy Camera (DEC) as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program, designed to study fast transients with 20s cadence imaging over 1-3 hr periods, with rapid candidate identification and coordination of follow-up observations. The survey found 96 flare events across 80 stars, and collected statistics such as percentage of flaring stars per spectral type, flare duration distribution, and flare frequency distributions with associated power-law slopes. They report a number of findings, such as volumetric flare rates of flares in 5 g-magnitude bins, a relationship between flare energy and distance from the galactic plane, and ~70% of flares having duration <8 minutes. 

### 1.2 Code Written

With some help, I wrote code that normalizes the input blackbodies and M dwarf spectrum such that the integrated flux over the optical range (3825-9200 angstroms) of a 10000K blackbody spectrum = integrated flux of the M dwarf spectrum = 1.0

## 3 Results & Future Goals

### 3.1 Results

We now have a functional calibration scheme wherein each input blackbody is normalizated such that the total energy emitted in the optical range by a blackbody at 10000K is 1. The total energy emitted by the M dwarf is also normalized to 1. 

### 3.2 Goals

With this calibration scheme, we can properly combine the blackbody and m dwarf spectra to simulate a flare spectral profile, which can be used to calculate the PSF shift due to DCR for different bands, airmasses, and flare temperatures. However, first the utils.py functions need to be modified to incorporate this calibration method.
